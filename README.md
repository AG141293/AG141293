Ankita Ghosh

🚀 Data Science & AI Engineer | LLM · VLM · NLP Practitioner | GenAI Pipeline Builder

I specialize in transforming raw, noisy, multilingual data into high-quality, AI-ready datasets and building scalable, production-grade GenAI systems. My work spans Machine Learning, NLP, Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision–Language Models (VLMs), and Generative AI, with a strong focus on real-world deployment and multilingual AI for Indian languages.

I actively build end-to-end GenAI pipelines — from data cleaning, validation, and augmentation to synthetic data generation, evaluation, and automation — ensuring robustness, correctness, and downstream usability.

🌱 Always learning, always curious.

💼 Experience
Machine Learning Intern — Makers Lab, Tech Mahindra

Project: INDUS — India’s Own Large Language Model

Worked on large-scale multilingual data preparation and augmentation for Indian language AI systems, contributing to dataset quality, robustness, and model readiness.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Normalization (Multilingual NLP)

Designed and implemented a robust multilingual data-cleaning pipeline for Hindi and mixed-language (Hindi + English) datasets, primarily educational and concept-based (Q&A, explanations).

Key Contributions:

Text normalization (whitespace, line breaks, encoding issues)

Removal of noisy tokens and unwanted artifacts

Mixed-language handling with selective translation

Protection of mathematical symbols, formulas, units, and operators

Conversion of Hindi numerals to English digits

Logic to preserve measurements and semantic correctness

Ensured CSV encoding safety (UTF-8, UTF-16, legacy formats)

📌 Result: Produced clean, model-ready datasets suitable for LLM training and evaluation.

🧪 Synthetic Data Generation (10× Dataset Expansion)

Built LLM-driven SDG pipelines using NVIDIA NIM (LLaMA-3.1-70B).

Highlights:

Expanded datasets 10× (≈3K → 30K+ rows)

Generated high-quality Hindi MCQs with:

Difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)

Cognitive levels (Recall / Understanding / Application)

Concept-wise alignment

Designed strict JSON-only output validation

Implemented:

Retry logic & failure handling

Checkpoint-based saving

Resume-from-failure capability

Cleaned malformed LLM outputs (escaping, LaTeX, broken JSON)

🧠 Core-Concept–Driven SDG

Generated synthetic questions anchored to core physics concepts, ensuring pedagogical correctness.

Conditioned generation on:

Concept name

Reference question

Educational grade constraints

📌 Used SDG outputs for training, evaluation, and benchmarking educational NLP models.

🗣️ LLM, NLP & Speech Systems

Curated multilingual Indian dialect datasets

Built pipelines for:

Dialect classification

Annotation & validation

Created 10,000+ dialectal variants

Evaluated performance using accuracy metrics

Implemented ASR pipelines

Measured transcription accuracy using Word Error Rate (WER) (jiwer)

Integrated real-time multilingual translation
